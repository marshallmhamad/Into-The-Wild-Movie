        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="first-p">One of the best-selling and most lauded American non-fiction authors, Jon Krakauer was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1954, and raised in Covallis, Oregon, where he took up mountaineering at a very early age. He first became well known as a writer for the outdoors magazine Outside. In 1990, Krakauer's work as a journalist for Outside and other publications was collected and published in a book called Eiger Dreams. In 1996, he published  Into the Wild, which spent two years on the New York Times bestseller list and remains one of the central works of recent American nonfiction. It also accrued to its author a number of awards and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.

Krakauerâ€™s other works include the nonfiction bestsellers Into Thin Air, his first-hand 1997 account of the most deadly Everest ascent of all time, Under the Banner of Heaven, investigates the nature of Mormonism and polygamy, and Missoula, which examines how rape cases are treated by colleges and the criminal justice system. In 2007, Into the Wild was adapted into a nonfiction feature film directed by Sean Penn.</p>
